# Testing Use Flow

Since useFlow hides within a hook or a component, there is no need for anything special towards testing.

A great way to test hooks is a library called ... test hook, which I wrote. You can use this to test the external API for any hooks you write.

To test components, I gravitate towards Enzyme.
